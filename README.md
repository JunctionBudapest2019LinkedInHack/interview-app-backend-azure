# Motivation
You are a young and ambitious tech wizard about to land a job of his dreams. There is one problem...

**THE INTERVIEW**

You know the interviews are tough and you prepare thoroughly for the infamous "Coding portion" of the process (which is usually most of the time). I will let you in on a secret:

Hence, we are providing you with a tool that will bring your softer part up to par with your technical prowes.
We cal it the "Job Bot"
